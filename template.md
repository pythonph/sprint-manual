## **General Information**

### **What is {Event name} Sprint?**

{Event name} Sprint is a day-long, community-driven activity where programmers of all skill levels contribute to Open Source Software (OSS).

* Open to beginners.
* You can contribute through code, documentation, tutorials, or by starting a new open-source project.  
* A GitHub account is required.  
* Knowing how to create a Pull Request is required. But if you don't know how, there will be a separate and short workshop at the start of the day. This way, you can join the sprint afterwards

### **Which Open Source Software (OSS) are allowed?**

* Any OSS actively looking for volunteers.  
* You can even start an OSS project during the event!

### **Why participate?**

* **Give back to the community.**  
* **Learn and grow:** Beginners can level up and gain experience contributing to OSS.

### **What contributions are expected?**

Your contributions depend on your knowledge of the OSS and your skill level:

* **Simplest tasks:** Documentation improvements.  
* **Next simplest tasks:** Writing tutorials or beginner guides for the OSS.  
* **Bug fixes!** Found a bug or issue that you think you can fix? Give bug hunting a try!

It's okay if you don't finish your task! Starting is what matters.

### **How do I register for the sprint?**

There will be signups during {event name}. Check the registration table during the breaks.

Since the Sprint takes place the day after the main {event name} program and has limited slots, walk-ins will not be allowed. Pre-registration during {event name} is required.

### **What do I need to bring?**

- Bring your own laptop or any development device you're comfortable with. Desktops or bulky machines are not recommended due to venue limitations.  
- Power outlets may be limited, so consider bringing a suitable power bank.  
- Bring a Mobile Internet WiFi device. While there is Internet at the venue, we can't guarantee stable connectivity once everyone starts uploading near the end of event.

### **What sprint groups are currently available?**

1. **{Title}**  
   * *Led by:* {Sprint lead}  
   * GitHub Link: {url}   
   * Description: Preferably, description is max 5 sentences.  

*Need help?* {Pull request workshop coach} will be on standby to assist beginners.

## **Pull Request Workshop**

Are you complete new to OSS contribution? Well, you need to know how to do a Pull Request as this is a fundamental skill. Don't know how? Join this workshop! Afterwards, you can contribute to the sprints. We're looking forward to your first pull request!

### **I don't know how to do a Pull Request? Is this required?**

For open source contributions, knowing how to do a pull request is required. Fortunately, we have a workshop hosted by {Pull request workshop coach} on the day itself. You can learn and contribute on the same day. Just be there when we start as the workshop is held in the morning.

### **Are we limited to the current sprints?**

No!

* You are free to create your own group based on your OSS interests.  
  * Bug fixing and Documentation are common things that OSS will always look for.  
* You can recruit members in the room to join your group.  
* Many OSS projects started out as sprints—maybe you'll launch a new one!

If you are planning to create your own group, approach {Sprint organizer} so they can create a channel for you.

### **How do we start contributing?**

* At the start of the day, each Sprint Leader will present their chosen OSS project.  
* If you have an OSS idea, you can present it during this time and call for volunteers.

### **As a Sprint Leader, what should I prepare before the day of the Sprint Session?**

* Figure out how to communicate with the core OSS team (e.g., Discord, IRC, forums).  
* Review their version control's `#first-issues` tags or ask the core team for tasks suitable for a day of work.  
* Identify areas for improvement in their tutorials or documentation.  
* Check if they accept translations.  
* Review the OSS's Code of Conduct and share it with your group.  
* Prepare a short 1-3 line blurb that Emcees can share during {Event name}. Think of this as your way of piquing the interest of attendees to join your group  
* Prepare a max 5 mins elevator pitch to present at the start of the sprint. This is just to share the possible contributions that you hope your group can contribute to. You may also use this time to convince others to join your group.  
* Feel free to share that you have a Sprint to {Event name} attendees. Who knows, maybe you will encourage and inspire someone to join your group!   
* If there are any questions, you can contact {Sprint leader} ({username} on event's channel)}

We will have a pull request workshop for beginners. We suggest preparing some easy tasks as they might be joining you after their workshop. 

Examples of potential tasks are:

* Add examples to docstrings or the documentations  
* Enhance or write more descriptive warning and error messages  
* Add missing docstrings  
* Add missing typing  
* Write simple tests to increase code coverage. These tests shouldn't need the coder to have a complete understanding of the entire OSS. Examples of test scenarios would be helpful.

### **As a participant, how do I start in the sprint?**

1. Introduce yourself to your chosen group.  
2. Choose a topic or issue to work on (from your leader's suggestions or based on your experience).  
3. Start hacking!

### **What is expected of participants?**

* Uphold the **Code of Conduct**: Both {event name}'s and the OSS's (if applicable).  
* Share your progress and feedback on {Sprint channel}. There will be dedicated channels for your group.   
* Don't stress about completing a task—gaining experience is a success on its own!
* Most importantly, **have fun!**

### **As a Sprint Leader, what do I need to know during the session?**

* Encourage and support your group members.  
* Remember, you are the face of your group, and members will look up to you for guidance and inspiration.  
* It's okay to make mistakes!  
* It's okay to start a sprint on something you don't know about. You can even spend the sprint learning about your OSS choice that you can share as a talk or to contribute documentations from a first-time user.  
* Encourage a collaborative atmosphere.  
  * Just let the participants work on what they want.  
  * Don't put pressure on mistakes.  
  * Have a place for participants to share their work status or to share links and documentation  
    * Done via {event's communication platform}, but we won't stop anyone from using their own tools.
* Let's foster a “chill” atmosphere. This should contrast with the non-stop talks and workshops during the main event.

### **What happens at the end of the Sprint Session?**

* Each group will present their contributions. Think of this like a lightning talk.   
* Group members may choose to talk individually about their own contributions.  
* Maximum of 2 minutes per participant. *Note: this time can be changed by to the event organizers*
* Put up screenshots or key moments on the Discord channel. This can be shown during your presentations.

- A printer. Preferably a quiet one or placed at a corner.

## **FAQ**

### **Is there lunch during the sprint?**

Yes! 

### **Do we still need to follow the Code of Conduct?**

Yes! For {Event name} Code of Conduct concerns, please approach {Sprint organizer} or any volunteers. 

It's possible for the OSS that you are contributing to have their own CoC that you need to adhere to. {Event organizer} can't police these, so please be respectful of the OSS' CoC.

### **I'm not an expert coder or I'm not familiar with the library** 

No problem! You can actually contribute from the perspective of a new coder or first-timer to the library.

One of the underestimated parts of OSS is not being newbie friendly. You can bring a fresh perspective and point out things that confuses you. Then, we can focus on improving that experience for other beginners!
